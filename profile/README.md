# Welcome! 👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼
**The publishing platform created by councils, for councils.** LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves money.

The [LocalGov Drupal website](https://localgovdrupal.org/) contains more information about the project, and how your council can get involved!

## Get involved
Right now, developers, UX designers, product managers, and content designers are collaborating to build something that is more than the sum of its parts. You can get involved by:

* [Setting up a development environment](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov) for testing and code contribution
* [Reading documentation](https://docs.localgovdrupal.org/content/) aimed at content designers, editors, and content managers
* [Opening a new issue](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/issues) to report a bug or suggest a new feature

-----
We welcome contribution from people of all backgrounds, in accordance with the [LocalGov Drupal Code of Conduct](https://localgovdrupal.org/about-lgd/code-conduct). If you would like to encourage your local council to get involved with this project, please direct decision-makers towards [this page](https://localgovdrupal.org/drupal-for-councils).
